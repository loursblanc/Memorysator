            explanation = "Are stars better appreciated for their art after they die? Actually, stars usually create their most artistic displays as they die. In the case of low-mass stars like our Sun and M2-9 pictured above, the stars transform themselves from normal stars to white dwarfs by casting off their outer gaseous envelopes. The expended gas frequently forms an impressive display called a planetary nebula that fades gradually over thousand of years. M2-9, a butterfly planetary nebula 2100 light-years away shown in representative colors, has wings that tell a strange but incomplete tale. In the center, two stars orbit inside a gaseous disk 10 times the orbit of Pluto. The expelled envelope of the dying star breaks out from the disk creating the bipolar appearance. Much remains unknown about the physical processes that cause planetary nebulae.",

            explanation = "This vintage 60-kopek stamp celebrates a dramatic achievement. On October 7th, forty years ago (7/X/1959), the Soviet interplanetary station which has come to be called \"Luna 3\" successfully photographed the far side of the moon giving denizens of planet Earth their first ever view of this hidden hemisphere. Lacking the digital image technology familiar now, Luna 3 took the pictures on 35mm film which was automatically developed on board. The pictures were then scanned and the signal transmitted to Earth days later in what was perhaps also the first interplanetary fax. In all, seventeen pictures were received providing enough coverage and resolution to construct a far side map and identify a few major features. Depicted on the stamp are regions dubbed the Sea of Moscow, the Soviet Mountains, the Bay of Astronauts, and the Sea of Dreams.",

Still, this composite of telescopic images follows the comet's progress as it moves away from the Sun beyond the orbit of Mars, from late September (left) through late November (far right). Its faint but extensive coma and tails are viewed against the colorful background of stars near the eastern edge of the constellation Leo. A year ago, before its perihelion passage, the comet was less active, though. Then the Rosetta mission's lander Philae made its historic landing, touching down on the surface of the comet's nucleus.",

At the end of that nearly equal night the Moon stands above a dense constellation of urban lights in this serene city and skyscape. Of course the Moon's waning crescent faces toward the rising Sun. Skygazers could easily spot bright Jupiter just above the Moon, close on the sky to a fainter Mars. Saturn, a telescopic favorite, is just a pinprick of light below and farther left of the closer conjunction of Moon, Jupiter and Mars. Near the ecliptic, even Mercury is rising along a line extended to the horizon from Jupiter and Saturn. The elusive inner planet is very close to the horizon though, and not quite visible in this morning's sky.",

The snapshot also captures our fair planet's own natural satellite in its young crescent phase. The Moon's disk looms large, its familiar face illuminated mostly by earthshine. Meanwhile, Jupiter's four largest moons are caught orbiting the distant world. Left to right they are Callisto, Ganymede, Europa, and Io. You can spot them along a line extending from the jovian giant's own disk. Remarkably, the moons are in almost the same order of brightness as their distance from Jupiter increases, with Callisto the dimmest and outermost, and Io the brightest and closest.",

The atomic emission is powered by the hot, massive stars of the embedded young galactic cluster. The shapes in the emission nebula are sculpted by winds and radiation from these massive stars, eroding the surrounding material and creating curved ridges, bright ridges, and dark indentations. At the nebula's center is the open cluster NGC 3532, around 500 light-years away, containing stars much older than the nebula's youthful stars. The image covers a region about 40 light-years across, captured by the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3. The blue color is due to scattered starlight, reflected by a mix of small dust particles.",

            explanation = "Why do some galaxies have a ring around the center? First and foremost, the only galaxies known to clearly have a ring around the center are barred spiral galaxies. One of the largest barred spirals known, NGC 6946, has an unusually prominent ring of stars and gas near its center that is best visible in infrared light. The blue and white colors of the spiral arms far from the ring indicate a strong ongoing star formation region, while the yellows and reds of the ring indicate older stars and more settled gas. This ring is not the only ring feature in NGC 6946 -- further out is another ring that is considerably larger and more diffuse. A leading progenitor hypothesis for ring galaxies is that they are the result of a collision with a smaller galaxy or cloud of gas and stars, although this remains a topic of investigation. NGC 6946, also known as the Fireworks Galaxy, is located only about 10 million light years away, so light that we see from it today left during the time of the dinosaurs.",

            explanation = "What created this unusual hole in Mars? The hole was discovered by chance on images of the dusty slopes of Mars' Pavonis Mons volcano taken by the HiRISE instrument aboard the robotic Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter currently circling Mars. The hole appears to be an opening to an underground cavern, partly illuminated on the image right. Analysis of this and follow-up images revealed the opening to be about 35 meters across, while the interior shadow angle indicates that the underlying cavern is roughly 20 meters deep. Why there is a circular crater surrounding this hole remains a topic of speculation, as is the full extent of the underlying cavern. Holes such as this are of particular interest because their interior caves are relatively protected from the harsh surface of Mars, making them relatively good candidates to contain Martian life. These pits are therefore prime targets for possible future spacecraft, robots, and even human interplanetary explorers.",

            explanation = "Sometimes it's night on the ground but day in the air. As the Earth rotates to eclipse the Sun, sunset rises up from the ground. Therefore, at sunset on the ground, sunlight still shines on clouds above. Under usual circumstances, a pretty sunset might be visible, but unusual noctilucent clouds float so high up they can be seen well after dark. Normally too faint to be seen, they may become visible just after sunset during the few weeks they are illuminated by sunlight. Noctilucent clouds are the highest clouds and are still poorly understood. They are every summer at high latitudes, but have been seen at lower latitudes as well. The featured image was taken last month near Arendal, Norway. High in atmosphere, about 80 kilometers up, the noctilucent clouds are near the edge of space and can reflect sunlight even in the middle of the night.",

            explanation = "What is the nearest major galaxy to our own Milky Way Galaxy? Andromeda. In fact, our Galaxy is thought to look much like Andromeda. Together these two galaxies dominate the Local Group of galaxies. The diffuse light from Andromeda is caused by the hundreds of billions of stars that compose it. The several distinct stars that surround Andromeda's image are actually stars in our Galaxy that are well in front of the background object. Andromeda is frequently referred to as M31 since it is the 31st object on Messier's list of diffuse sky objects. M31 is so distant it takes about two million years for light to reach us from there. Although visible without aid, the above image of M31 is a digital mosaic of 20 frames taken with a small telescope. Much about M31 remains unknown, including exactly how long it will before it collides with our galaxy.",

Each of these galaxies houses billions of stars - just as our own Milky Way Galaxy does. Although nearby when compared to most other clusters, light from the Coma Cluster still takes hundreds of millions of years to reach us. In fact, the Coma Cluster is so big it takes light millions of years just to go from one side to the other! Most galaxies in Coma and other clusters are ellipticals, while most galaxies outside of clusters are spirals. The nature of Coma's X-ray emission is still being investigated. In the above deep photograph, many galaxies are even visible far beyond the Coma Cluster.",

            explanation = "How far away are Venus and Jupiter? They are not as far apart as they look -- from Earth's perspective. In a conjunction of stunning proportions, Venus and Jupiter converged to less than a quarter degree in Earth's sky last month. This conjunction, although impressive to see without any technical aids, was captured in full glory above the historic Chapel of the Holy Cross in Sedona, Arizona, USA. To compare, the angular width of the Sun or the Moon is about 0.5 degrees, so Venus and Jupiter were only about half the width of the Sun from each other. To better understand the positions of Venus and Jupiter in the sky, you can play the delightful time-lapse sequence by sliding the time indicator at the bottom of the featured image, or you can examine this digitally superposed eclipse image taken from New South Wales, Australia, a day before the total solar eclipse earlier this month. Soon after this conjunction, Venus sunk toward the Sun while Jupiter rose toward the dawn, passing near Saturn and the horizon during subsequent months.",
